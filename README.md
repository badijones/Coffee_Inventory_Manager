# Code Challenge / Web Developer Challenge

(Instructions and my work from a previous developer interview)

1. Create PHP object(s) that can be used to ingest a TSV file (**data.csv**) of available coffee types into the API.
  -   **Coffee.php** 
2. Using your PHP object(s) from task 1, create a CLI PHP script that will ingest a given absolute path to a TSV file of available coffee types.
  - **cli.php**
3. Create an html page that displays all available coffee types in the API. This page should use ajax for performing request(s) to the API.
  - **index.html**
